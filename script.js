    <p class="text">Elie Wiesel, the respected Nobel Prize winner, activist, professor and Holocaust survivor, has spoken numerous times about the importance of both hope and gratitude. In a November 2000 interview, he emphasized the value of gratitude that, ‘When a person doesn’t have gratitude, something is missing in his or her humanity. A person can almost be defined by his or her attitude toward gratitude.’ On the subject of hope, Wiesel once said, ‘Just as despair can come to one only from other human beings, hope too, can be given to one only by other human beings.’
    <br><br>
    These remarks should strike a chord with any Hwa Chong student , given our school’s emphasis on 饮水思源 as well as 己立立人，己达达人。
    <br><br>
    As the world grapples with numerous issues plaguing the globe — from the Covid-19 pandemic to climate change, from  social and racial injustice to territorial disputes — and as our nation navigates a new normal, I cannot help but think of Wiesel’s wise words. In these times, it is crucial for us to pause, take a moment to reflect, and perhaps adjust our mindsets, not only for our well-being, but so we can be sources of hope to one another. As Wiesel reminds us, hope is a gift, freely given to one human being by another.
    <br><br>
    It is my hope, then, that as we come together as a school to celebrate the achievements of the cohort of 2020 — one which completed the High School journey under unprecedented circumstances — we also take a moment to consider how we can practise gratitude, and how we can significantly make a difference by bringing positivity to those around us. As educators, parents, student leaders and friends, we should take some time to pause and reflect: what might my student, my son or my friend, be going through — and how can I make the day better for this person? And if we are on the receiving end of kindness, we should take some time to ask ourselves: how can I say thank you for this gift, and how can I pay it forward? 
    <br><br>
    In Confucius’ Analects, his disciple Zeng Zi (曾子) aptly captures the spirit of reflection as part of self-cultivation (修身) through the following lines, “I examine myself daily on three aspects: whether, in my course of work or duty, I may have been not faithful or loyal; whether, in my relations with friends, I may have been not sincere; whether I may have not mastered and practised the teachings of my teacher." (“吾日三省吾身：为人谋而不忠乎？ 与朋友交而不信乎？ 传不习乎？”) We can see from this that integrity, sincerity and gratitude are at the core of Confucius’ ethics and form the cornerstone of inter-personal relations. 
    <br><br>
    These are questions I would especially like you, students of Hwa Chong, to reflect upon. I hope you make time to ponder the many things you can be grateful for, and take action and express your gratitude to the people who have brought something good to your lives. Every year, we present awards to deserving recipients at this ceremony which is termed Founders’ Day Prize Giving Ceremony.  It is with the hope that all of you will remember with a deep sense of gratitude what our founders have bestowed upon us, and to emulate and carry on their legacy not just by speaking of gratitude— but actually to live  their lives in service of these values. 
    <br><br>
    The young gentlemen featured in this website have taken a small step on an important journey: we must congratulate them on the grit and spirit of 自强不息 they have shown, in particular in overcoming various challenges and constraints throughout  a tumultuous year brought about by Covid-19. At the same time, it is my hope that they will build on their experiences in High School, and continue their journeys in a way  our founders can be proud of.
    <br><br>
    Allow me to express my gratitude, as well, to the broader Hwa Chong community which helps to nurture our young men — our board members, parents, alumni, partners and volunteers. You play a crucial role in shaping our students’ education, one which is all the more important in these uncertain times. Let us continue to work together in helping our young men grow into global citizens capable of bringing hope to others!

His diligence and resilience go a long way in making him an all-rounder and he harbors the spirit of perseverance in whatever he does.

Ian is an empathetic, pragmatic, well-read, and humble young man who is extremely popular amongst his peers and various other students in HCI. He never refuses to help anyone who might require it.

He is empathetic and believes in actively contributing back to society and volunteers his time at Willing Hearts, a non-profit organization that cooks free meals for the needy.
